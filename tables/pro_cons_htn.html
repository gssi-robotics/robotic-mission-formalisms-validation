<p>
  HTNs have the strength of explicitly expressing pre- and post-conditions, which provide the support for binding abstract tasks to multiple methods that can realize decision-making through runtime planning. The task decomposition obtained by refining abstract tasks into methods naturally realizes a modular structure. As a drawback, choices can not be embedded explicitly into the model, since planning is always required.
  <br>
  No support for reactiveness, and no mechanisms to handle task status is provided within the model definition, relegating this feature to both external documentation/modeling and behavior implementations.

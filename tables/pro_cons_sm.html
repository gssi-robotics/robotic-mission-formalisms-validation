<p>
  SMs employs transitions from states to explicitly distinguish between different events and different outcomes of the actions executed by the robots within each state. This allows the mission model to unambiguously distinguish different events and error causes, and to explicitly redirect the flow towards the states modeling their handling.
  <br>
  As a drawback, handling events that can potentially affect every state require outgoing transitions from each of them, hence making the model more complex. Organizing states hierarchically allows reducing such complexity. Similarly, for resuming a temporarily interrupted mission, transitions towards all the possible interrupted states have to be modeled. This also requires the specification of ad hoc <i>selector</i> states, hence contributing to the model complexity.
  <br>
  The handling of temporal-related behaviors has to be manually realized within the single state logic, as well as the interaction with other robots, systems, and humans.

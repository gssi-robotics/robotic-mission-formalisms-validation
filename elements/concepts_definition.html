    <li><strong><em>Skill</em></strong>: programmed action that represents a basic capability of the robot. It is implemented at a lower level and exposed as a reusable action for the mission specification.</li>
    <li><strong><em>Task</em></strong>: symbolic representation of a higher-level robotic behavior realized as a combination of skills. Tasks specify what must be done and abstracts from the concrete implementation</li>
    <li><strong><em>Data</em></strong>: information used or produced during execution and shared across tasks or components to parametrize skills/tasks.</li>
    <li><strong><em>Communication</em></strong>: the exchange of information between the robot and external entities (humans, robots, systems).</li>
    <li><strong><em>Events</em></strong>: occurrences that may trigger or influence the mission flow.</li>
    <li><strong><em>Errors</em></strong>: events that arise from faults, failures, or any unexpected conditions preventing the mission from being executed without proper handling.</li>
    <li><strong><em>Pre-/Post-conditions</em></strong>: formalize the states of the system before and after the execution of a task or skill.</li>

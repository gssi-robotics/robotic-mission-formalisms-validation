    <i>Skill</i>: programmed action that represents a basic capability of the robot. It is implemented at a lower level and exposed as a reusable action for the mission specification.<br>
    <i>Task</i>: symbolic representation of a higher-level robotic behavior realized as a combination of skills. Tasks specify what must be done and abstracts from the concrete implementation<br>
    <i>Data</i>: information used or produced during execution and shared across tasks or components to parametrize skills/tasks.<br>
    <i>Communication</i>: the exchange of information between the robot and external entities (humans, robots, systems).<br>
    <i>Events</i>: occurrences that may trigger or influence the mission flow.<br>
    <i>Errors</i>: events that arise from faults, failures, or any unexpected conditions preventing the mission from being executed without proper handling.<br>
    <i>Pre-/Post-conditions</i>: formalize the states of the system before and after the execution of a task or skill.<br>
